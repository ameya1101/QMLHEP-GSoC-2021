# QMLHEP-GSoC-2021

This repository contains my attempts to the evaluation task for ML4Sci's QMLHEP project on "Quantum Neural Networks for High Energy Physics Analysis at the LHC". There are 4 files (3 IPynb and 1 PDF), each containing the attempt for each task. Task 5 involved a writeup, so that is included as a PDF, while the other task attempts are IPynb files with appropriate file names.
